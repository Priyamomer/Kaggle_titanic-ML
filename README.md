# Kaggle_titanic-ML

This repo contains the Kaggle Titanic ML project
The submissions folder contains my submissions file of the kaggle and the project code in .ipynb file

In the project our goal it to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
For each in the test set, we must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.
